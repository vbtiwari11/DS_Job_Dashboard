# DS_Job_Dashboard
The Interactive Dashboard for comparison between different Data Science jobs and salaries provided by Tech giants in India.

While exploring through the kaggle datasets to practice my visualization game I came acrosss the Data Science Jobs in India dataset which was quite interesting to work with since it contained different profiles related to Data Science fields along with the salaries and MNC names.Now while trying to add the interactivity I came across the Dash module of Python which helps us to create the actual interactive dashboards using html components and created this project to visualize the comparisons among different profiles and salaries which vary in accordance with experience and companies.
